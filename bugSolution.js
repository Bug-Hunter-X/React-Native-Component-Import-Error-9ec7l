The solution is to use the correct import path. Ensure you have the correct directory structure, and use the correct file extension (.js or .jsx). For instance, ensure your import path correctly points to the component's location and has the appropriate extension.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent'; // Correct import path

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MyComponent />
  );
};

export default App;
```
